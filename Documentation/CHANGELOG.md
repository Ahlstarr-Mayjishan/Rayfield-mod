# Changelog

## 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Updated exploiter runtime module URLs to the correct GitHub repo owner/path.
- Added shared `MODULE_BASE_URL` usage in `Main loader/rayfield-modified.lua`.
- Fixed all-in-one URL mapping for:
  - `Main loader/rayfield-modified.lua`
  - `feature/rayfield-enhanced.lua`
  - `feature/rayfield-advanced-features.lua`
- Fixed minimized-state handling in elements modules by injecting `getMinimised`.
- Stabilized `Tab:Clear()` flow against concurrent tracking modifications.
- Added lifecycle cleanup for `MemoryLeakDetector`:
  - `stopMonitoring()`
  - `destroy()`
  - cleanup on shutdown and explicit `Rayfield:Destroy()`.

### Notes
- These changes target executor/exploiter runtime reliability.
- Studio-only flow remains secondary.
